# Predictive-maintenance-for-Wind-Turbines-using-ML
Predictive model for wind turbine generator failures using sensor-based data. The project builds and tunes classification models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, XGBoost) to identify failures early, reducing maintenance and replacement costs. Feature importance analysis highlights key sensors driving predictions.
